# GoNature Shopping Store Project

## Description:
This README provides an overview of my final project as part of my graduate at HackerU college.
The project includes a store of fruits, vegetables and nuts, built by using TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB and designed by sass.
The project allows users to browse and purchase products from the store.


## Features
User authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out. Only authenticated users can access certain features like adding items to their cart and making purchases.

Product catalog: Users can browse through a wide range of products available in the store. Each product displays its details such as name, description, price, and an image.

Search functionality: Users can search for products using keywords or specific filter by name.

Shopping cart: Authenticated users can add products to their cart, update quantities, and remove items. The cart displays the total price and allows users to proceed to checkout.

## Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used for the client-side development of the shopping store application.

Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. It is used to build the server-side logic and handle API requests.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database system. It is used to store products information, user data, and messages from the customers.

Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js. It is used to handle routing, middleware, and API endpoints.

Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a simple and straightforward way to interact with the database.
